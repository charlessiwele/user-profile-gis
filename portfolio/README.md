## 🐳 Why Docker?

### The Challenge with Local Setup

This application uses **GeoDjango**, which requires **GDAL** (Geospatial Data Abstraction Library). Installing GDAL locally can be challenging because:

❌ **Complex Dependencies**
- Requires C++ build tools (Visual Studio on Windows, gcc/g++ on Linux)
- Multiple system libraries (GDAL, GEOS, PROJ)
- Version compatibility issues between Python and GDAL
- Different installation methods per operating system

❌ **Platform-Specific Issues**
- Windows: OSGeo4W or conda required, DLL naming conflicts
- Linux: Multiple package managers, library paths
- macOS: Homebrew dependencies, linking issues

❌ **Time-Consuming Setup**
- Can take 30-60 minutes to resolve all dependencies
- Debugging cryptic error messages
- Environment conflicts with other projects

### The Docker Solution

✅ **Zero Local Dependencies**
- No need to install GDAL, C++ compilers, or system libraries
- Everything pre-configured in the Docker image
- Works identically on Windows, Mac, and Linux

✅ **5-Minute Setup**
- `docker-compose up --build` - that's it!
- No environment variables to configure
- No PATH issues or library conflicts

✅ **Consistent Environment**
- Same versions across all machines
- Development matches production
- Easy team collaboration

✅ **Isolated & Clean**
- Doesn't affect your system Python
- No version conflicts with other projects
- Easy to remove completely

**Bottom Line**: Docker eliminates hours of troubleshooting and lets you focus on the application, not the infrastructure.

- Track user access patterns
- Investigate security incidents
- Audit trail for compliance

**Example Queries (Django Shell):**
```python
from app.models import UserActivityLog
from django.utils import timezone
from datetime import timedelta

# Failed logins in last 24 hours
recent_failures = UserActivityLog.objects.filter(
    action='failed_login',
    timestamp__gte=timezone.now() - timedelta(days=1)
)

# Specific user's login history
user_history = UserActivityLog.objects.filter(
    username='john_doe',
    action='login'
).order_by('-timestamp')

# All activity from an IP address
ip_activity = UserActivityLog.objects.filter(
    ip_address='192.168.1.100'
)
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Docker-Related Issues

#### Container Won't Start

**Problem:** Container exits immediately or fails to build

**Check logs:**
```bash
docker-compose logs web
```

**Common solutions:**
```bash
# Rebuild without cache
docker-compose build --no-cache

# Check Docker Desktop is running
docker info

# Remove and recreate containers
docker-compose down -v
docker-compose up --build
```

#### Port 8000 Already in Use

**Error:** `Bind for 0.0.0.0:8000 failed: port is already allocated`

**Solution:** Change the port in `docker-compose.yml`:
```yaml
ports:
  - "8001:8000"  # Use port 8001 instead
```

Then access at `http://localhost:8001/`

#### Database Locked Error (SQLite)

**Problem:** `database is locked` error in Docker

**Solution:** Restart the container:
```bash
docker-compose restart web
```

For production, use PostgreSQL (see Production Deployment section)

#### Changes Not Reflecting

**Problem:** Code changes don't appear in running container

**Solution:**
```bash
# Restart the container
docker-compose restart web

# If still not working, rebuild
docker-compose up --build
```

### Application Issues

#### Permission Denied / Can't Access Admin

**Problem:** Regular users can't access admin or other profiles

**Expected behavior:**
- Admin access requires `is_staff=True`
- Viewing all profiles requires `is_superuser=True`
- Regular users can only see their own profile

**Check user permissions:**
```bash
docker-compose exec web python manage.py shell
```
```python
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
user = User.objects.get(username='your_username')
print(f"Staff: {user.is_staff}, Super: {user.is_superuser}")
```

#### Map Not Loading

**Problem:** Blank map or stuck on loading screen

**Solutions:**
1. Check browser console (F12) for errors
2. Ensure user has location set (latitude/longitude)
3. Verify internet connection (map tiles load from CDN)
4. Check Docker logs for API errors

#### Activity Logs Not Appearing

**Problem:** No logs created when logging in/out

**Solution:** Ensure migrations have run:
```bash
docker-compose exec web python manage.py migrate
docker-compose restart web
```

#### "View All Users on Map" Error

**Problem:** Error when clicking "View All Users on Map" in admin

**This has been fixed!** The issue was with `user_id=None` being passed as a string. If you encounter this:
```bash
# Pull latest code and restart
git pull
docker-compose restart web
```

### Getting More Help

**View detailed logs:**
```bash
# All logs
docker-compose logs

# Follow logs in real-time
docker-compose logs -f web

# Last 100 lines
docker-compose logs --tail=100 web
```

**Access container shell for debugging:**
```bash
docker-compose exec web /bin/bash

# Inside container, you can:
python manage.py shell
python manage.py check
python manage.py showmigrations
```

**Check database:**
```bash
docker-compose exec web python manage.py dbshell
```

## 🛠️ Advanced Setup (Local Installation)

> ⚠️ **Warning**: Local installation requires complex dependencies including C++ build tools and GDAL. **We strongly recommend using Docker instead** (see Quick Start section above).

### Why Local Setup is Complex

Installing this application locally requires:
- C++ compiler (Visual Studio Build Tools on Windows, gcc/g++ on Linux)
- GDAL library with matching Python bindings
- Multiple system libraries (GEOS, PROJ, SpatiaLite)
- Platform-specific configuration
- Potential conflicts with other Python projects

**Estimated setup time:** 30-60 minutes (vs. 5 minutes with Docker)

### Prerequisites for Local Installation

- Python 3.11
- C++ Build Tools:
  - **Windows**: Visual Studio Build Tools or MinGW
  - **Linux**: `build-essential` package
  - **macOS**: Xcode Command Line Tools
- GDAL 3.6+ with development headers

### Step 1: Install System Dependencies

**Windows (using conda - Recommended):**
```bash
# Install Miniconda first: https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html
conda create -n portfolio python=3.11 "gdal=3.10.3" -c conda-forge
conda activate portfolio

# Fix DLL naming issue (Windows only)
copy "%CONDA_PREFIX%\Library\bin\gdal.dll" "%CONDA_PREFIX%\Library\bin\gdal310.dll"

# Install Django packages
pip install django djangorestframework gunicorn
```

**Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):**
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y \
    python3.11 \
    python3.11-venv \
    gdal-bin \
    libgdal-dev \
    g++ \
    gcc \
    build-essential \
    libsqlite3-mod-spatialite
```

**macOS:**
```bash
brew install python@3.11 gdal
```

### Step 2: Setup Python Environment

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python3.11 -m venv venv

# Activate
# Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# Linux/Mac:
source venv/bin/activate

# Install Python packages
pip install django djangorestframework gunicorn

# Install GDAL Python bindings (match system version)
pip install GDAL==$(gdal-config --version)
```

### Step 3: Configure and Run

```bash
# Run migrations
python manage.py migrate

# Create superuser
python manage.py createsuperuser

# Run development server
python manage.py runserver
```

### Local Installation Troubleshooting

#### GDAL Not Found

**Error:** `Could not find the GDAL library`

**Windows:** Ensure `gdal310.dll` exists (see Step 1)
**Linux:** `export GDAL_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libgdal.so`
**Mac:** `export GDAL_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/homebrew/lib/libgdal.dylib`

#### C++ Compiler Missing

**Error:** `error: Microsoft Visual C++ 14.0 or greater is required`

**Solution:** Install Visual Studio Build Tools:
https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/

#### Version Conflicts

**Error:** `GDAL version mismatch`

**Solution:** Match Python GDAL version to system:
```bash
# Check system version
gdal-config --version

# Install matching Python package
pip install GDAL==<version>
```

### Why We Recommend Docker

After setting up locally, you might encounter:
- DLL/library path issues
- Version mismatches
- Environment conflicts
- Platform-specific bugs
- Time spent debugging instead of developing

**Docker eliminates all of these issues.** Consider switching to Docker for a better experience.

## 🛠️ Development

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
python manage.py test app

# Run with verbosity
python manage.py test app -v 2

# Run specific test class
python manage.py test app.tests.UserProfileTestCase

# Run specific test method
python manage.py test app.tests.UserProfileTestCase.test_profile_created_automatically
```

### Creating New Users

**Via Admin Interface:**
1. Admin → Users → Add User
2. Set username and password
3. Save and continue editing
4. Set email, name, permissions
5. Profile automatically created via signal

**Via Command Line:**
```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

**Via Django Shell:**
```python
from django.contrib.auth.models import User

# Regular user
user = User.objects.create_user('username', 'email@example.com', 'password')

# Staff user
staff = User.objects.create_user('staff', 'staff@example.com', 'password', is_staff=True)

# Superuser
admin = User.objects.create_superuser('admin', 'admin@example.com', 'password')
```

### Database Management

**Backup Database:**
```bash
python manage.py dumpdata > backup.json
```

**Restore Database:**
```bash
python manage.py loaddata backup.json
```

**Reset Database:**
```bash
# Delete database file
rm db.sqlite3

# Run migrations
python manage.py migrate

# Create new superuser
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

### Adding Profile Fields

1. **Update Model** (`app/models.py`):
```python
new_field = models.CharField(max_length=100, blank=True, null=True)
```

2. **Update Form** (`app/forms.py`):
```python
class UserProfileForm(forms.ModelForm):
    class Meta:
        fields = ['home_address', 'phone_number', 'new_field']
```

3. **Update Template** (`app/templates/app/profile_view.html`):
```html
<div class="info-item">
    <span class="info-label">New Field:</span>
    <span class="info-value">{{ profile.new_field }}</span>
</div>
```

4. **Create and Run Migration:**
```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

### Customizing Theme

Edit `app/templates/app/base.html`:

```css
/* Change gradient colors */
body {
    background: linear-gradient(135deg, #YOUR_COLOR1 0%, #YOUR_COLOR2 100%);
}

/* Change primary color */
.btn-primary {
    background: linear-gradient(135deg, #YOUR_COLOR1 0%, #YOUR_COLOR2 100%);
}
```

### Production Deployment

**Settings to Change:**

1. **DEBUG**: Set to `False`
2. **SECRET_KEY**: Use environment variable
3. **ALLOWED_HOSTS**: Add your domain
4. **DATABASES**: Use PostgreSQL with PostGIS
5. **STATIC_ROOT**: Configure for static files
6. **Security Settings**:
   ```python
   CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE = True
   SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE = True
   SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT = True
   ```

**Collect Static Files:**
```bash
python manage.py collectstatic
```
